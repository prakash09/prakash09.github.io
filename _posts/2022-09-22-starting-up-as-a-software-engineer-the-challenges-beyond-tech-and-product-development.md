title: "Starting up as a software engineer: the challenges beyond tech and product development"

---
I've loved coding ever since I got my first computer in 8th grade. I was a boring kid, so the first thing I did was learn to touch type. Soon, I could easily do over 40WPM. One day, one of my friends shared a music file, and as soon as I opened it, my CD drive started automatically opening and closing. Then, after 5 seconds, there was a message on the screen that said "Your system is hacked," and the system shut down. 

I got curious about how this was done, so I asked my friend's brother (who is an engineer) to teach me. I learned a few tricks from him and then started learning on my own. I learned how to write batch scripts and do basic web development. I also dual-booted my system and installed Linux. I became a hero in my school group when I started cracking wifi passwords with Wiffy Script. By the time I reached 12th grade, I was sure I wanted to study Computer Science and Engineering in college.


## Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug
In my first year of college, I got in touch with some seniors and started attending Hackathons and tech meetups. I started getting a sense of what the industry needs and started focussing on building the relevant skills. 

I had a group of 5 teammates, and we used to go as a team. After a few losses and embarrassing presentations, we started winning. Every month new phones, cash prizes and I even got a chance to meet the President of India, Dr Pranab Mukherjee. 

Hackathons forces you to think of a problem and solve it within a time range and we used to participate every weekend. All through my time in college, except the final year, every weekend I was always out. I was always in some Hackathon, meetup or workshop. Sometimes we used to brainstorm some ideas and then read about a similar startup getting funded after a few days. 

After winning a few Hackathons and coding contests, my friends and I got confidence and started thinking about starting up. We used to build a product, spent some time on it but eventually shut it down. Never understanding why people were not using our product, there was no one to guide us. I used to watch HBO's silicon valley as a college lecture, questioning why they did what they did, and Richard was my Hero.

## Experiencing magic
I had the opportunity to work as an intern at Zimply, a home decor e-commerce startup, when the company was just getting off the ground. The founders were recent graduates from IIT Roorkee, and the team consisted of only 3 or 4 members. I worked very closely with the founders and CEO Ishaan Bhola, who entrusted me with a lot of responsibility. I got to experience the process of building a product from scratch and watching it take off. I joined the company as a full-time employee while I was still in college, attending classes in the morning and working at the office from 2pm to 9 or 10pm. I saw the team grow from 4 or 5 members to 50 or 60 over the course of that year, and it was a great learning experience that boosted my confidence.

## Focus and preparation for the battle
I used to spend a lot of time on Quora, sometimes 5-6 hours a day. I found answers by Gaurav Munjal and started following him on Twitter. He recommended "The Golden Tap" by Kashyap Deorah and my journey of reading business books began with that book. Whenever he used to follow someone, I used to follow them blindly. By doing that, I became part of tech twitter and started recognising the people running the industry and their thought processes. 

I also started getting a lot of recommendations for books people were reading; I read approx. 30 business books during the two years before starting my startup. 

In my head, it was clear that I wanted to start up. The only thing that wasn't clear was when? 

Even working as a software engineer, I never restricted myself to one thing. I worked most of the time as a backend engineer but also worked with the frontend/mobile teams for a few months. I sometimes had tough conversations with my managers as to why I can't stick to one thing, but I was clear, it doesn't matter how bad or slow I am in frontend/mobile, but I should have the understanding if I want to start up and lead a team.

## First Flight
Preparation for the startup is easy; you are very much in control of how hard you want to work/study. Starting up is a very different beast.

Naval once said - 
> `"I can't watch Roger Federer play tennis and swing the racket the same way. Nor will any description from him on how to swing the racket get me to swing it the right way. At some level, the details are not transmissible and are not copyable." ```

Now it's not only about you. Although it's tough, the most challenging part is not developing a product or developing business understanding because you control your time and effort. It is directly proportional to your efforts. The hardest part is the number of things seeking your attention and running the day by a calendar. Just from the top of my head: 
- Hiring 
- Building Systems 
- Personal Productivity
- Maintaining Relentlessness and Obsession 
- Structured Learning 
- Team management 
- Stakeholder Management 
- Strategy and Planning 
- Execution

##### Raising Funds
Saksham and I started with our own money, but within six months, we realised we were not on the right path, the product we were building didn't have a big market.
Raising the seed round was relatively easy when we switched to game streaming. Initially, we got angel money from top Angels, and then they introduced us to more investors. With Lightspeed and  Surge saying yes, we closed our seed round(details will be part of another blog) of $2M within a month of starting.

##### Defining culture, setting expectations and company values
Building a great product starts with building a great team. And hiring great people is hard. Really hard. As a leader, you can become the bottleneck for the quality of people joining the team. 

Again improving and working on yourself is easy. Andreessen Horowitz, in his book "The Hard Thing about Hard Things", says - "The hard thing isn't hiring great people. The hard thing is when those "great people" develop a sense of entitlement and start demanding unreasonable things."

This was something I learned early on when we hired our first senior engineer. I used to report to him in a previous company, so when he came on board, it was like having Richard and Ethan from Silicon Valley in the mix. We accepted some of his initial demands, but they were never-ending. From increasing his salary in 3 months to knowing details of investor interactions - he wanted to know it all. I took a stand and soon after he and his other referral left. It forced me to define the company values and communicate expectations upfront. It also made me think about our culture. 

As a young founder, it can be really tough to retain people. You start questioning your abilities and go into a self-deprecating loop about what you could have done better. Reaching out to mentors or working with a leadership coach can help. But soon you realize that you need missionaries, not mercenaries. And you accept your limitations.

There's a lot of knowledge on the internet but doing what works for you at the moment is probably the best. Avoiding conflict is not an option.

##### Going from 0-1 to 1-N and sorting internal visibility
As the team grows, you start losing visibility overall; you can't meet each team member daily. If you have a fast-growing startup with multiple products, the rules of the game change faster than expected. Initially, you focus on the execution speed with very short release cycles and embrace chaos; overall, communication is easy. 
But the anxiety of not getting transparency is overwhelming when five leads/EMs lead a team of 8-10 members, each working remotely on a different project. You can do standups but talking to 40 members to keep a check on their motivation and challenges are impossible. 

I found the right balance: "when you are confident, the leader running the team is more obsessed than you about the team's success" it's time to let them run the team, focus on agreed metrics review, and do the same with others managers till everyone reaches there. 

Expecting everyone to be comfortable with chaos is unfair. You start moving toward order and building processes, but be careful whatever you build should improve efficiency overall. Some examples are standardising interview rounds, handling incidents, regular 1-1s, defining transparent career paths and probably revisiting every initial decision like deployment, and writing only critical flow test cases to internal dashboards. 

We came up with something like this for weekly metrics review:

##### Extending visibility and Building trust with the business teams
When you're busy and someone posts about a product issue, the business team may not know the issue's intensity and assume the worst. 
To build trust with the business team, here are two things that have helped me: 
1. When something goes wrong, someone from the tech team announces it first in a public group. We should also write detailed RCAs for SEV-1/SEV-2 issues. 
2. Define success metrics and report them weekly in the public group. For example: uptime, tech tickets, etc.

##### Working with people with very different values
With increasing scale, you hire team members with experience handling large systems since they have not seen your journey yet. Their constant complaint will be how chaotic it still is and how they had six months clear roadmap in their last organisation with better quality of systems and colleagues. The only thing that has worked for me is that there are only two types of people: energy-givers and energy-takers. 
At any stage of the company, if you spend half an hour with them, you'll quickly be able to tell which category they fall into. 
1. Energy givers - You will feel motivated, inspired and willing to put in the extra effort. 
2. Energy-takers - You will feel tired, drained and demotivated. They will make you miserable.

So, when hiring new team members, always go for the energy-givers. They may not have experience handling large systems, but they will be more positive and enthusiastic about the journey ahead.

## Internal Struggle
You haven't coded in the last six months and you're feeling out of touch. You start reading Hacker News daily and try GTP-3, Dall-e, and VR. You read about advancements in Web3 and get serious FOMO. You come across a friend who is building in the same space and invest in their startup and miss the early days of building.
