title:  Setting expectations with your team; why it's important

---

As a founder, hiring the best people and keeping them motivated is one of the primary duties. It can be tough to find people who are aligned with the vision and willing to work with us, but it's worth it to invest the time to find talented people and convert them into believers. The key is to set the right expectations and communicate constantly to ensure everyone is on the same page and set the team up for success.

Here I am listing some points -
1. Your early team members are your influencers; choose wisely.
2. Make people believers in 90 days - Assign a buddy to the new hire who is already a believer.
3. No person is more significant than the company, including the founders.
4. Integrity and values should be topmost.
5. No one can claim trust; they will have to earn it by consistently delivering on their commitments.
6. If you accept substandard work, it becomes the new standard.
7. A real evaluation of a person/colleague: Always ask how that person makes you feel about yourself? When you come out of a meeting, are you feeling drained? or energised?
8. Good leaders are good self evaluators.
9. Run the team like a sports team.
10. Always keep looking for people with the founder’s DNA in the company. People who go out of their line of duty.
11. Don’t take criticism from people whom you will not take advice.
12. People want to be trusted and do not put people behind processes early on.
13. People should understand the mission well to feel that It’s not about them; it’s about a bigger purpose.
14. Break conflicts using the core values of the company.
15. From the VP level, excuses don’t matter.
16. Every person should have a one-on-one meeting with the reporting manager every month.
17. Celebrate small successes.
18. Communicate more in times of crisis.
