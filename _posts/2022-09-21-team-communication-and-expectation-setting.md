title:  Setting expectations with your team; why it's important

---

As a founder, one of your key responsibilities is to hire the best talent and keep them engaged. It's challenging to find individuals who share your vision and commitment, but it's crucial to take the time to identify and inspire these talents to believe in your mission. The most important aspect is to clearly set expectations and maintain open communication to ensure unity and prepare your team for success.

Here I am listing some points:

1. Your early team members are your influencers; choose wisely.
2. Integrity and values should be top priorities.
3. It's important for everyone to understand the mission well, to feel that it’s not about them, but about a bigger purpose.
4. No person is more significant than the company, including the founders.
5. Run the team like a sports team.
6. Accepting substandard work sets it as the new standard.
7. Use the company’s core values to resolve conflicts.
8. Trust is vital; avoid putting people behind processes too early.
9. No one can claim trust; it must be earned by consistently delivering on commitments.
10. To truly evaluate a person/colleague, ask yourself how that person makes you feel. Do you feel drained or energized after meeting with them?
11. Good leaders are adept at self-evaluation.
12. Always be on the lookout for people with the founder’s DNA within the company. Look for those who go beyond their duty.
13. Don’t take criticism from people from whom you wouldn't accept advice.
14. From the VP level up, excuses don’t matter.
15. Every person should have a one-on-one meeting with their reporting manager every month.
16. Make people believers in 90 days - Assign a buddy to the new hire who is already a believer.
17. Celebrate small successes.
18. Communicate more in times of crisis.
